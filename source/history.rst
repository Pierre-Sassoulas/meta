 The History of the PyCQA
==========================

The PyCQA has a short, but interesting history.

.. _formation:

Creation of the PyCQA
=====================

On 2014 September 12, Ian Cordasco `sent an email
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/code-quality/2014-September/000348.html>`_
to the code-quality mailing list with the idea to migrate Flake8 from
Mercurial to Git.

The response was positive with the caveat that Free Software should be
developed on similarly Free Software (GitLab). Ian was uncomfortable
transferring the project to his own personal GitLab account so in jest and
following the example of other groups (`PyCA <https://github.com/pyca>`_,
`PyPA <https://github.com/pypa>`_, etc.), he created a GitLab group for the
project. He also created a GitHub organization with the same name so he could
mirror Flake8 to GitHub and accept contributions there. As the sole maintainer
of flake8-docstrings, Ian also migrated that project from Mercurial to Git and
onto GitLab (with a mirror on GitHub).


pep8 joins the organization on GitHub
=====================================

After a while as the only member, Ian invited Ian Lee to join the PyCQA with
pep8. Following some conversations, pep8 and its development team (mostly Ian
Lee, but also its creator, Johann Rocholl, and former maintainer, Florent
Xicluna) `moved to the PyCQA
<http://www.coglib.com/~icordasc/blog/2015/07/moving-pep8-to-the-pycqa.html>`_
in July of 2015.


Pylint and Astroid move to GitHub and the PyCQA
================================================

In October of 2015, Florian Bruhin `sent an announcement
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/code-quality/2015-October/000673.html>`_ to
the code-quality mailing list that Pylint and Astroid would be moving to Git
and GitHub from Mercurial and BitBucket. Over the course of the ensuing
discussion, it was suggested that they also join the PyCQA and in December of
2015 the migration was complete.


mccabe and pep8-naming move to the PyCQA organization
=====================================================

Around the same time, Ian Cordasco moved more projects that he maintained into
the PyCQA namespace. This time he moved both mccabe and pep8-naming which were
previously maintained in the `Flintwork <https://github.com/flintwork>`_
organization.


pydocstyle (formerly pep257) moves to the PyCQA organization
============================================================

In early January of 2016, Guido van Rossum asked that pep257 change its name.
The usage of "PEP" was apparently creating confusion among users causing bugs
to be reported to the PEP repository. Vladimir
Keleshev, the creator of pep257, and Amir Rachum, the active maintainer,
decided to move the project to the PyCQA. On 29 January 2016, the move and
rename was complete and Amir joined the PyCQA with pydocstyle.

Baron and RedBaron join the PyCQA
=================================

On 2016 March 28, the author of Baron and RedBaron `sent a message to the
code-quality mailing list
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/code-quality/2016-March/000732.html>`_
about a new release and the need for more contributors and maintainers. At
that point, the organization extended an invitation for Laurent Peuch to join
with both Baron and RedBaron. The transfer was completed on 2016 March 31.

Bandit moves to the PyCQA organization
======================================
On 2018 February 26, the authors of Bandit `sent a request to the
code-quality mailing list
<https://mail.python.org/pipermail/code-quality/2018-February/000976.html>`_
to accept Bandit from the OpenStack namespace to the PyCQA. The
transfer was completed on 2018 May 2.

modernize joins PyCQA
======================================
On 2020 August 18, Thomas Grainger, as a maintainer of the project, requests that modernize be moved into the PyCQA organization.
With the support of all project maintainers in place, the transfer was completed on 2020 August 23.

isort joins PyCQA
======================================
On 2020 August 23, Timothy Crosley, the author of isort sent a request for the project to be moved into the PyCQA organization.
The transfer was completed on the same day.
